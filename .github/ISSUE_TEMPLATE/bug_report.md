A feature request is not a bug. Feature requests are welcome. Follow [this link](https://github.com/renatomb/open-rport/discussions/categories/roadmap-feature-wishes-ideas).

In case you know it. Is the bug related to `rportd` (server) or `rport` (client)?

**Environment**

* RPort version
* OS details (Linux distribution, and version or Windows version)
* Is rportd running inside a docker container?
* Are you using a reverse proxy? If yes, which one?

**Log file**
Before submitting a bug report, inspect the log files of client and server.

[Increase the log level to debug](https://github.com/renatomb/open-rport/blob/0.9.0/rport.example.conf#L169-L171) and try to reproduce the error.
